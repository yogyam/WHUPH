If you have seen the office, in season 9, Ryan tries to start a start up called WHUPH, that contacts someone in EVERY way possible. 
Later on in that episode, Jim tells him that this idea is not practical and would only be useful in emergencies. 

My aim with this project is to make an app such that you can contact someone for emergencies.
